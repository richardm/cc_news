# Research and Create Recommendation

You are a software architect making technology recommendations for this project:
- Research how I can accomplish my "objective" which will be defined below.
- Use tools to search or browse the web and generate a list of candidate tools / libraries to consider
- Create a Candidate Report doc including the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate
- Finally, review the report
- Consider tradeoffs of each.
- Save the report to `research/{topic-name}.md`

## Candidate Report

Use the following format:
- A clear Executive Statement indicating the objective
- A TOC listing every candidate being considered
- A section for each candidate summarizing key research points
- A summary of which candidates are finalists and which ones should be rejected
- A final recommendation

## Executive Statement
- Capture the objective
- Capture any functional requirements
- Generate a list of follow up questions to ask stakeholders (e.g. VP of Engineering, Lead Engineer, and/or Product Owner) to further guide the research.
- Ask the user these follow up questions and capture any responses provided.

## Candidate Summary

Every candidate summary should contain the following:
- Which functional requirements the candidate meets
- Any functional requirements the candidate does not meet
- Candidate's stability and adoption stats (see below)

Stability and Adoption Stats:
Check the GitHub repos and/or package managers (e.g. npm / pypi) to collect these:
- Prefer projects which are widely adopted and stable.
- Document the following:
- How many years has project been around?
- Many commits?
- Is project still actively maintained? (Recent commits and/or low issue count)
- Low unresolved issue count
- How many stars and forks in the GitHub repo
- How many downloads per day or per week (based on package manager)
- Is project backed by a reputable company?
- Any other relevant details

Next, consider each of the candidate tools, based on how well they meet my specified needs as well as the stability / adoption rate of the project (based on the factors outlined above).
